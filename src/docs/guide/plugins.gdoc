If you want to make your Grails plugins available to other people, then the best approach is to publish them using this plugin. The publication process is straightforward:

# Package the plugin as a zip or jar
# Deploy it to a Maven repository
# Optionally notify a plugin portal of the release

The [publish-plugin|commandLine] command does all of this for you.
